# Get georeferenced Twitter data using Tweepy
A python script using tweepy that streams Twitter data for a given geographic region (city name) and stores the tweets as point features in an ESRI File Geodatabase.

The image below shows a subset of 600,000+ georeferenced tweets sent by Twitter users during two weeks in Fall 2015, in the Greater Mexico City region. The patterns of tweet locations reflect major streets and transportation hubs, as well as tourist attractions.
